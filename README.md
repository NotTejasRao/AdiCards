AdiCards
======
A flashcard web app created in Python using Django.

Coding Conventions:
-----------

1. Use "from file.py import ClassName" for classes, and "import path.to.file.py as file" to reference definations.
2. Prefix html files with the object they interact with (ex. flashcard) and suffix with what it helps do to them (ex. create) -- ie. flashcard_create.html is acceptable.
